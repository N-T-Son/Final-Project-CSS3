      <h2>Fun Facts About Bunnies & Hares</h2>
      <p>Bunnies and hares belong to the Leporidae family and are known for their strong hind legs and long ears.</p>
      <p>Unlike rabbits, hares are born with fur and open eyes. They are also more solitary and live above ground.</p>
      <p>Bunnies are very social animals and enjoy the company of other rabbits. They communicate using body language and soft sounds.</p>
      <p>Both bunnies and hares have nearly 360-degree vision, helping them detect predators from almost any angle.</p>
      <p>Rabbits can turn their ears 180 degrees to pinpoint sounds, which is essential for their survival in the wild.</p>
